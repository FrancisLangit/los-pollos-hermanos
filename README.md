## Background

### Why was this made?

This project was created in partial completion of The Odin Project's Full-stack JavaScript Curriculum, particularly in submission of its Restaurant Page project assignment.

The main challenge presented was to create a website featuring any restaurant of choice primarly using Webpack to bundle the repository's files. Moreover, it was also prompted for developers to construct such while using minimal HTML. As such, should one have a look at the `index.html` file of repository, one will find that it contains next to nothing as most of the website's content creation can be found in its JavaScript files.
